## Build instructions

> :construction: This project requires a compiler with C++17 support.

1. Before proceeding further download the [actual map pack](https://aiarena.net/wiki/maps/).

1. Put the downloaded maps into the `Maps` folder (create it if the folder doesn't exist):
   * Windows: `C:\Program Files\StarCraft II\Maps`
   * OS X: `/Applications/StarCraft II/Maps`
   * Linux: anywhere.

### Windows

For building for Windows under WSL2, see [WSL2 Support](#wsl2-support).

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

1. Download and install Visual Studio ([2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or newer).

1. Get the project.

   ```bat
   git clone git@github.com:cpp-sc2/blank-bot.git
   ```

1. Enter the working directory.

   ```bat
   cd blank-bot
   ```

1. Create Visual Studio project files in the directory "build".
   E.g. for Visual Studio 2022:

   ```bat
   cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
   ```

1. Build the project using Visual Studio.

   ```bat
   start build\BlankBot.sln
   ```

1. Launch the bot with the specified path to a SC2 map, e.g:

   ```bat
   build\bin\Debug\BlankBot.exe Ladder2019Season3/AcropolisLE.SC2Map
   ```

### macOS

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

1. Install XCode.

1. Install XCode command-line tools.

1. Clone the project.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:cpp-sc2/blank-bot.git && cd blank-bot
   ```

1. Generate CMake build tree.

   ```bash
   cmake -B build
   ```

1. Build the project.

   ```bash
   cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
   ```

1. Launch the bot with the specified absolute path to a SC2 map, e.g.:

   ```bash
   ./build/bin/BlankBot "/home/alkurbatov/Ladder2019Season3/AcropolisLE.SC2Map"
   ```

### Linux

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

1. Install `gcc-c++`.

1. Install the `make` utility.

1. Get the project.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:cpp-sc2/blank-bot.git && cd blank-bot
   ```

1. Generate CMake build tree.

   ```bash
   cmake -B build
   ```

1. Build the project.

   ```bash
   cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc)
   ```

1. Launch the bot with the specified absolute path to a SC2 map, e.g.:

   ```bash
   ./build/bin/BlankBot "/home/alkurbatov/Ladder2019Season3/AcropolisLE.SC2Map"
   ```

## Additional options

### WSL2 Support

Cross compiling for Windows under WSL2 is supported through `cpp-sc2`. See the `cpp-sc2` [documentation](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/cpp-sc2/blob/master/docs/building.md#wsl2-support) for build requirements. The build flag remains the same, setting `-DWSL2_CROSS_COMPILE=ON`.

### Game client version
By default, the API assumes the latest version of the game client. The assumed version can be found in cmake's output, e.g.:
```bash
$ cmake -B build grep 'SC2 version'
Target SC2 version: 5.0.5
...
```

However, sometimes one may need to compile with an older version of the game, e.g. to play with a Linux build which is
always behind the Windows version. It is possible by specifying the game version manually, e.g.:
```bash
cmake -B build -DSC2_VERSION=4.10.0
```

### AIArena ladder build
To compile a bot capable to play on [the AIArena ladder](https://aiarena.net), configure the project in the following way:
```bash
cmake -B build -DBUILD_FOR_LADDER=ON -DSC2_VERSION=4.10.0
```

## Managing CMake dependencies

`BlankBot` uses the CMake `FetchContent` module to manage and collect dependencies. To use a version of `cpp-sc2` outside of the pinned commit, modify the `GIT_REPOSITORY` and/or the `GIT_TAG` in `cmake/cpp_sc2.cmake`:
```
...
FetchContent_Declare(
    cpp_sc2
    GIT_REPOSITORY <target-cpp-sc2-git-rep>
    GIT_TAG <git-commit-hash>
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(cpp_sc2)
...
```
With the updated configuration, re-run the build configuration and the dependency will be updated to the new configuration:
```
cmake -B build
```

## Troubleshooting

### CMake options don't take effect

If you see that some of cmake options don't take effect
(e.g. project was configured with `cmake -B build -DBUILD_FOR_LADDER=ON` and a bit later with `cmake -B build`)
remove the `build` folder or the `CMakeCache.txt` file, or explicitly re-specify the desired default behavior (e.g. `cmake -B build -DBUILD_FOR_LADDER=OFF`).

### Build freezes (Linux or macOS)

If project compilation freezes, decrease nproc to 1 or more, e.g.:

``` bash
cmake --build build --parallel $(nproc --ignore=1)
```
